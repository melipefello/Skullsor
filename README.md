Cursor moving prototype to test a gameplay mechanic with visual feedback.
Probably inspired by [Mouselash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210870/).
Made in Unity 2022.3.

It's made of a few feedback handlers, nothing fancy, I wanted to test a maintainable not over-architecte way to handle feedbacks and control their lifecycle.

_Turn the audio on for some popping sound effects._
